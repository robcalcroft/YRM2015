	<h1>Schedule</h1>
	<p>
		All participants are invited to give a short (15 minutes + 5 minutes for questions) talk on their research. These talks will be organised into tracks which reflect different fields of research.
	</p>
	<p>
		There will be plenary and keynote talks from <a class='link-main' href="speakers">distinguished speakers</a> across mathematics, a poster competition, and a Quantitative Finance workshop from G-research. There will also be a three course conference dinner at Somerville College, Oxford; this will initially be limited to 100 places but we hope to release more places soon.
