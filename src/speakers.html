	<h1>Our Speakers</h1>
	<p>
		We have a fantastic group of speakers this year. They bring knowledge and expertise from all corners of mathematics to the conference. We're exited to welcome speakers from all over the country and around the world.
		<br>
		Our speakers will hold, at least, one one hour lecture in the main theatre. See the schedules page to see when each speakers lecture is.
