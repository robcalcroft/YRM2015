			<div class="faq-q">Q: I need an overhead projector, what do I do?</div>
			<div class="faq-a">A: Please find the person chairing your session and check that it is in a compatible format.

It would be easiest if you can transfer your slides using a USB stick, but it is possible to connect an external laptop to the projector system if need be.</div>
			<div class="faq-q">Q: How long is my talk?</div>
			<div class="faq-a">A: All delegates' talks will be 20 minutes, with up to 5 minutes for questions at the end. In order to make sure that people have enough time to transfer between rooms between talks, people leading the sessions will be strict about cutting speakers off after their time is up.</div>
			<div class="faq-q">Q: How does the poster competition work?</div>
			<div class="faq-a">A: There will be a poster session in which delegates and judges can look at the posters, hear your explanation of your poster's content and ask you questions. There will be a prize and also glory.</div>
			<div class="faq-q">Q: What is the G-research quantitative finance workshop</div>
			<div class="faq-a">A: On Tuesday we will host a very exciting interactive workshop run by professional Quantitative Researchers from G-research. The workshop will be a discussion of some of the mathematical issues involved in portfolio construction. You will have the opportunity to consider one or more open-ended investment problems and come up with your own, mathematically based trading strategies. These will be run competitively against each other for the chance of a prize! No prior knowledge of finance is necessary, but some familiarity with the very basic terminology of investment and risk management would be beneficial.</div>
