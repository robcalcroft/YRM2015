There are many, many cafes in central Oxford which offer reasonably priced breakfasts, e.g. the <a class=”link-main” href="http://www.turlstreetkitchen.co.uk/about/visit">Turl St Kitchen</a>, <a class="link-main" href="http://www.oxford-coveredmarket.co.uk/cafes-and-restaurants5-2/">Brown's Cafe</a> or <a class="link-main" href="http://thewavecard.com/discounts-shop-Heroes-Sandwich-Bar-123">Heroes</a>.
