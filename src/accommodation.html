	<h1>Accommodation</h1>
	<p>
		We have arranged to offer a limited number of discounted rooms at Lincoln College to conference attendees from Â£30 a night. These rooms are on Turl St in historic central Oxford, 15 minutes from the conference venue. They can only be booked through our website, when you register for the conference.</p>
	<p>
		The room price does not include breakfast. There are many cafes on the walk to the conference venue which offer a reasonably priced cooked breakfast. We suggest the <a class='link-main' href="http://www.turlstreetkitchen.co.uk/about/visit">Turl St Kitchen</a>, <a class='link-main' href="http://www.oxford-coveredmarket.co.uk/cafes-and-restaurants5-2/">Brown's Cafe</a> or <a class='link-main' href="http://thewavecard.com/discounts-shop-Heroes-Sandwich-Bar-123">Heroes</a>. There are also branches of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Pret a Manger, Costa, McDonalds etc.</p>
