	<h1>Where are we?</h1>
	<p>
		YRM2015 will be held in the Andrew Wiles Building (Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford). A limited number of discounted rooms are available for YRM attendees at Lincoln College, a 10 minute walk away in the centre of Oxford. The conference dinner will be held at Somerville College, next door to the Mathematical Institute.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are a short walk from Oxford train and coach stations. See <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">National Rail</a>, <a href="http://www.nationalexpress.com/home.aspx">National Express</a>, or <a href="http://uk.megabus.com">megabus</a> for cheap advance coach tickets.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are travelling by car, we recommend using the <a href="http://www.parkandride.net/oxford/html/oxford_frameset.html">Pear Tree Park and Ride</a> and catching the bus route 300, which stops opposite the Mathematical Institute. Accessible parking places at the Institute are available by prior booking with a clear explanation of the circumstances of need.
