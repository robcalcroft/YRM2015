	<h1>BMC/BAMC</h1>
	<p>
		We are grateful to the London Mathematical Society for funding 30 bursaries for PhD students attending both the 4th Joint British Mathematical Colloquium &amp; British Applied Mathematics Colloquium (<a class="link-main" href="https://sites.google.com/site/bmcbamc15/">BMC/BAMC 2015</a>) and YRM2015. These cover the cost of the registration fee for YRM2015.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		If you want to claim a bursary, you must <a class="link-main" href="mailto:info@yrm2015.co.uk">contact us</a> as soon as possible. If your application is successful then, once you have attended both the BMC/BAMC 2015 and YRM, we will be able to refund your registration fee for YRM2015.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="italic text-bold">
		Correction: A previous version of this page incorrectly stated that the registration fee for the BMC/BAMC would be refunded. It is in fact the YRM2015 registration fee which is refunded. Weâ€™re very sorry for this mistake.
